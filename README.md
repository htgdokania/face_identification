# face_identification

detect any particular face

#instruction to use:

1. first open 2nd step folder
2. next in the images folder add a folder of person you need to identify .also add few images of that person
3. move back and run faces-train.py
4. finally run faces_ref.py to detect the faces

##work is still in progress to complete the  faces_detect.py

the person can now be detected along with previous persons which were already added  by their id(displayed at the time of executing the faces_train.py)

# NOTE:
you may have to run this before running the code:(to use the recognizer)
